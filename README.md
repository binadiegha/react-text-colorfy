# React-text-colorfy

A simple and easy to use react component that helps you add gradient or color to text in your react project.

## üîç Overview
We have observed that most developers would like to speed up the process of applying color or a gradient to specific text or a string of sentences during development. There is a lot of CSS code needed. especially if your app's colors vary between distinct locations.
This is why I created ***react-text-colorfy***, a straightforward component-based solution that enables developers to add colors or gradients¬†to headings and other text components / tags.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation
Adding ***react-text-colorfy*** to your project requires just a few lines of code. tho, it is not worthy that this library have a few dev dependencies: react and styled-components.

to use this package, ensure you have npm installed on your computer. if you dont already have Nodejs installed, head to <a src="https:/https://nodejs.org/en//" target="_blank"> https://nodejs.org/en/ </a> and download Nodejs to your computer.

After setup, Run:

```
npm install react-text-colorfy
```
...and that's it. you are ready to use ***react-text-colorfy*** in your project.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Usage
To use ***react-text-colorfy's*** `text` component in your react project, import the package:

```javascript
import Text from 'react-text-colorfy'
```
Now you can use the ***react-text-colorfy*** `Text` component in your application.

*Code example*
```javascript
<Text 
  element="heading"
  color="rgb(64, 227, 212)"
  ...
/>
```
##### *Result*

## üìö Documentation
This section outlines the usage of the accepted props


### content
The `content` prop accept the text to be passed into the component. it accepts a string with the text intended to be colored enclosed in tripple angle bracket ( `<<<` )

#### syntax
the major syntax to note is the `<<<` and `>>>` syntax. text enclosed in the triple-angle-brackets are the target text that change in color.

*Code example*

<Text 
  content='this is <<< Colored >>> and this is <<< Colored too >>>. Hurray!'
  ...
/>
```

### color
The `color` prop accepts any CSS color value or name passed as a `string`: HEX, rgb, color name, etc are all accepted. see the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_colors.asp" target="_blank"> CSS color reference </a>  for more insight on css colors. defaults to the project's primary color.

### gradient
The gradient `prop` accepts an `object` with two `required` properties. `to` and `colors`.
The `to` key takes any CSS gradient Direction or angle property. See the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp" target="_blank"> CSS gradient reference </a> for more insight.
The second required property with the `key` of `colors` takes in an `array` of gradient colors as it's value.

*Code example*
```javascript
const myGradient = {
  to: 'bottom left',
  colors: ['rgb(64, 227, 212)', 'red', '#45af5b']
 }
  <Text 
    gradient={myGradient}
    ...
